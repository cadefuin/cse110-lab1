## Athenaeum

### Combat
The combat scene was the most important and the most frequently revised.

The combat scene in the itch.io build was vastly different to the concepts due to new interface requirements and issues found during playtesting.

### Menu
Although the menu concept included settings and other features, it was largely simplified to only show the inventory.

Like the combat scene, the inventory needed a few changes for the itch.io build.

### Map
The map scene mostly stayed the same through concepting and the itch.io build.
