### Video Games
My favorite video games have inspired other interests, namely:
- *Minecraft* was the birthplace of my love for programming, since I liked making minigames with command blocks.
- *Hollow Knight* was an unforgettable experience (I'm looking at you, *Path of Pain*) and inspiration for some UI designs.
- *NieR: Automata* inspired my interest in philosophy and UI design. Their menus were so appealing, I customized my desktop to look like it.
